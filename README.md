# Fork of Elm Tutorial 6 by Tensor Programming

![Calculator in Elm](calc.png "Calculator PNG")

This is just my fixes to update the code for elm 0.19



# A simple Calculator made with Elm by Tensor Programming

## Run `elm package install` before running `elm reactor` or `elm
   make` so that this app will actually be able to build.

## To build the app, use `elm-make todo.elm`, otherwise you can use
   `elm reactor` to run the app on a dynamic server.

### You can also dynamically build the application by copy and pasting
    the code into the [elm try online
    app](http://elm-lang.org/try). (make sure to remove the first line
    of code first).
